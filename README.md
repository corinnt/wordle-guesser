Generates possible guesses for the wordle!

Example:

![alt text](example_guess.png?raw=true)

Use the -g flag to indicate green letters; use the -y flag to indicate yellow letters.
Each letter may be followed by multiple indices to handle duplicate letters.

This guess would be entered as:

	-g o 2 u 3 -y t 5

This will return all viable guesses containing 'o' at position 2, a 'u' at position 3, and a 't' at any position other than 5:

	possible guesses: {'tough', 'route', 'pouty', 'mouth', 'youth', 'south', 'touch'}

Enter 'found' to quit.

Happy wordling!
